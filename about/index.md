## Projects

This section contains awesome projects that I've developed:

### ANPR (Bangladesh)

##### Automatic number plate recognition system. (All rights to TigerIT Ltd.)

An automatic license plate recognition system, based on several deep learning models for each task, i.e. automatic license plate detection, finding text area, and recognition of city name, vehicle class and number simultaneously.

Language & Tools: Python, PyTorch, Flask, Deep Learning

### FRS

##### Robust face recognition system for office surveillance. (All rights to TigerIT Ltd.)

A surveillance application system for recognizing intruders in corporate office premises. The deep learning framework PyTorch has been used with transfer learning from open-source trained models.

Language & Tools: Python, ONNX, Flask, PyTorch, Deep Learning

### EmoCam

##### Emotion Based Video Recommendation System. (Personal)

An approach towards video recommendation system based on emotion read from the face of a user in front of the camera.

Language & Tools: Python, NodeJS, Keras

### Corella

##### An NLP based Dialogue Engine. (All rights to TigerIT Ltd.)

Corella is the heart of AI-driven application KinderMate which is targeted to kids' entertainment and knowledge. It synthesizes kids' search query using NLP techniques and automates decisions to pull contents from predefined knowledge pools. It has also hand-crafted conversation mode that helps kids learning through conversation games.

Language & Tools: Python, Java, OpenDial, OpenNLP, Gensim, Scikit-Learn

### DocRefiner

##### A document image refiner. (All rights to TigerIT Ltd.)

An automated image resizing and refining tool that aligns the skewed images of the documents as much as possible without losing any vital information i.e. writing, figures, signatures, seal, etc. It can adjust brightness by increasing intensities of semi-washed data. It also reduces file size without losing readability of the document.

Language & Tools: Python, Computer Vision, Keras, Neural Networks

### OCR for Number Plate Recognition of Nepal EVR

##### OCR based automated QA of number plates. (All rights to TigerIT Ltd.)

The ultimate goal of this domain-specific application is a quality assurance of the vehicle's number plate after emboss printing. The application can detect zone name, plate number, plate color, font color, screw holes and SIT tag holes.

Language & Tools: C++, OpenCV

### EVR Tajikistan & Nepal

##### Vehicle Registration System for Tajikistan and Nepal. (All rights to TigerIT Ltd.)

This enterprise solution allows people of Tajikistan (and Nepal with different requirements) to register vehicle information, capture owner’s photo, signature, fingerprints and upload other necessary documents. Later on, this information can be used to search the details of any vehicle and renewing the registration. This system can also find the criminal match for a vehicle.

Language & Tools: Java, Spring

### 3D Carrom Board Modeling

##### An OpenGL graphics project to modol carrom board.

A C++ project which was targeted to implement all basics of Computer Graphics i.e. modeling, lighting, shading and movements of objects with the help of OpenGL library.

Language & Tools: C/C++ OpenGL
