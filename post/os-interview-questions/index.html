            </div><div class="content" id="content"><h2 id="1-what-is-an-operating-system">1. What is an operating system?</h2>
<p>An operating system is a program that acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer hardware. The purpose of an OS is to provide a convenient environment in which user can execute programs in a convenient and efficient manner.</p>
<h2 id="2-what-are-the-different-operating-systems">2. What are the different operating systems?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Batched operating systems</li>
<li>Multi-programmed operating systems</li>
<li>Time sharing operating systems</li>
<li>Distributed operating systems</li>
<li>Real-time operating systems</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="3-what-are-the-basic-functions-of-an-operating-system">3. What are the basic functions of an operating system?</h2>
<p>Operating system controls and coordinates the use of the hardware among the various applications programs for various uses. Operating system acts as resource allocator and manager. Also operating system is control program which controls the user programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer. It is especially concerned with the operation and control of I/O devices.</p>
<h2 id="4-what-is-kernel">4. What is kernel?</h2>
<p>Kernel is the core and essential part of computer operating system that provides basic services for all parts of OS.</p>
<h2 id="5-what-is-difference-between-micro-kernel-and-macro-kernel">5. What is difference between micro kernel and macro kernel?</h2>
<p>Micro kernel is a kernel which run services those are minimal for operating system performance. In this kernel all other operations are performed by processor.</p>
<p>Macro Kernel is a combination of micro and monolithic kernel. In monolithic kernel all operating system code is in single executable image.</p>
<h2 id="6-what-is-dead-lock">6. What is dead lock?</h2>
<p>Deadlock is a situation or condition where the two processes are waiting for each other to complete so that they can start. This result both the processes to hang.</p>
<h2 id="7-what-is-a-process">7. What is a process?</h2>
<p>A program in execution is called a process.</p>
<p>Processes are of two types:</p>
<ol>
<li>Operating system processes</li>
<li>User processes</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="8-what-are-the-states-of-a-process">8. What are the states of a process?</h2>
<ol>
<li>New</li>
<li>Running</li>
<li>Waiting</li>
<li>Ready</li>
<li>Terminated</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="9-what-is-starvation-and-aging">9. What is starvation and aging?</h2>
<p>Starvation is Resource management problem where a process does not get the resources it needs for a long time because the resources are being allocated to other processes.</p>
<p>Aging is a technique to avoid starvation in a scheduling system.</p>
<h2 id="10-what-is-semaphore">10. What is semaphore?</h2>
<p>Semaphore is a variable, whose status reports common resource, Semaphore is of two types one is Binary semaphore and other is Counting semaphore.</p>
<h2 id="11-what-is-context-switching">11. What is context switching?</h2>
<p>Transferring the control from one process to other process requires saving the state of the old process and loading the saved state for new process. This task is known as context switching.</p>
<h2 id="12-what-is-a-thread">12. What is a thread?</h2>
<p>A thread is a program line under execution. Thread sometimes called a light-weight process, is a basic unit of CPU utilization; it comprises a thread id, a program counter, a register set, and a stack</p>
<h2 id="13-what-is-process-synchronization">13. What is process synchronization?</h2>
<p>A situation, where several processes access and manipulate the same data concurrently and the outcome of the execution depends on the particular order in which the access takes place, is called race condition. To guard against the race condition we need to ensure that only one process at a time can be manipulating the same data. The technique we use for this is called process synchronization.</p>
<h2 id="14-what-is-virtual-memory">14. What is virtual memory?</h2>
<p>Virtual memory is hardware technique where the system appears to have more memory that it actually does. This is done by time-sharing, the physical memory and storage parts of the memory one disk when they are not actively being used.</p>
<h2 id="15-what-is-thrashing">15. What is thrashing?</h2>
<p>It is a phenomenon in virtual memory schemes when the processor spends most of its time swapping pages, rather than executing instructions. This is due to an inordinate number of page faults.</p>
<h2 id="16-what-is-fragmentation-tell-about-different-types-of-fragmentation">16. What is fragmentation? Tell about different types of fragmentation?</h2>
<p>When many of free blocks are too small to satisfy any request then fragmentation occurs. External fragmentation and internal fragmentation are two types of fragmentation. External Fragmentation happens when a dynamic memory allocation algorithm allocates some memory and a small piece is left over that cannot be effectively used. Internal fragmentation is the space wasted inside of allocated memory blocks because of restriction on the allowed sizes of allocated blocks.</p>
<h2 id="17-what-are-necessary-conditions-for-dead-lock">17. What are necessary conditions for dead lock?</h2>

<li>Circular wait (where p[i] is waiting for p[j] to release a resource. )</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="18-what-is-cache-memory">18. What is cache memory?</h2>
<p>Cache memory is random access memory (RAM) that a computer microprocessor can access more quickly than it can access regular RAM. As the microprocessor processes data, it looks first in the cache memory and if it finds the data there (from a previous reading of data), it does not have to do the more time-consuming reading of data from larger memory.</p>
<h2 id="19-what-is-logical-and-physical-addresses-space">19. What is logical and physical addresses space?</h2>
<p>Logical address space is generated from CPU; it bound to a separate physical address space is central to proper memory management. Physical address space is seen by the memory unit. Logical address space is virtual address space. Both these address space will be same at compile time but differ at execution time.</p>
<h2 id="20-differentiate-between-compiler-and-interpreter">20. Differentiate between Compiler and Interpreter?</h2>

When the data is no longer used / needed, the mutex is set to unlock.</p>

<h2 id="61-what-is-the-translation-lookaside-buffer-tlb">61. What is the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)?</h2>
<p>In a cached system, the base addresses of the last few referenced pages is maintained in registers called the TLB that aids in faster lookup. TLB contains those page-table entries that have been most recently used. Normally, each virtual memory reference causes 2 physical memory accesses- one to fetch appropriate page-table entry, and one to fetch the desired data. Using TLB in-between, this is reduced to just one physical memory access in cases of TLB-hit.</p>
